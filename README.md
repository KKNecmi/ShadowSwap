## :dart: Game Idea

- A **light character** appears in the **upper half** of the screen  
- A **shadow character** moves in the **bottom half**  
- They move **simultaneously**, but one moves in the **opposite direction**  
- Goal: Reach the **correct goal tiles** with both characters at the same time  
- A level-based concept designed to **challenge your brain with mirrored movement**
